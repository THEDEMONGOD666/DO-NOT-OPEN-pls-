                        Computational thinking includes decomposition (breaking problems into smaller parts), pattern recognition (identifying trends), abstraction (focusing on key features), algorithm design (creating step-by-step solutions), and testing (ensuring solutions work). <br>
                        You can develop these skills by solving puzzles, drawing flowcharts, and learning Python. <br>
                        Helpful resources are online courses like Coursera and coding practice on Codecademy.

                        Python basics include variables (to store data), data types (like integers, strings, lists), conditionals (if-else statements for decision-making), loops (for and while for repetition), and functions (reusable blocks of code).<br> 
                        You can practice these by writing simple programs, using online resources like Codecademy or Coursera to learn and improve your coding skills.

                        Usability heuristics include visibility of system status (keeping users informed), match between system and real world (using familiar language), user control (easy to undo actions), consistency (uniform design), error prevention, recognition over recall, flexibility, minimalist design, and help users recover from errors. <br>
                        These principles guide good user interface design and improve user experience.

                        Web design involves several core components: **HTML** for creating the structure of web pages, **CSS** for styling and visual presentation, and **JavaScript** for adding interactivity and dynamic features. <br>
                        A key part of modern web design is **responsive design**, which ensures that websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices. <br>
                        To get started, practice building simple websites, experiment with layouts and design techniques, and utilize resources like W3Schools, freeCodeCamp, or Codecademy to deepen your understanding and skills. <br>

                        Web development involves three main technologies: **HTML** (for structuring content), **CSS** (for styling and layout), and **JavaScript** (for adding interactivity). <br>
                        The frontend is what users interact with, while the backend handles server-side processes like databases and authentication. <br>
                        To get started, practice building simple websites, learning both frontend and backend development. Helpful resources include freeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, and platforms like Codecademy for more hands-on tutorials and projects. <br>
